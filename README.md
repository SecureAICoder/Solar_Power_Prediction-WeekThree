# Solar_Power_Prediction-WeekThree
# Description
This project involves training and evaluating a machine learning model to predict solar power output. The dataset is preprocessed, and a Random Forest Regressor model is trained using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

# Steps Involved
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Loading the preprocessed dataset
3. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
4. Defining hyperparameter tuning space for Random Forest Regressor
5. Performing grid search with cross-validation
6. Training the best-performing Random Forest Regressor model
7. Making predictions and evaluating the model

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- GridSearchCV
